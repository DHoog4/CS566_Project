# RSA Encryption Algorithm: An In-Depth Review

## Introduction
The RSA encryption algorithm is one of the most widely used algorithms today. It uses some remarkable concepts taken from number theory, developed almost three centuries ago.

This project describes the math being the algorithm, detailing the steps in moderate detail, and describing how the unique characteristics of prime numbers play a key role. The steps are executed in Python and multiple examples are shown. New examples or test cases can easily be input to see how the algorithm performs. 

## Technologies
* Python 3.10.12

## Resources
We didn't write most of the code, rather it was adapted from:

* [Olivier Faurax](https://gist.github.com/ofaurax/6103869014c246f962ab30a513fb5b49)
* [Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc110y/fall/notes/08-cryptography/05-rsa-cryptosystem-implementation.html)
* [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-generate-large-prime-numbers-for-rsa-algorithm/)

## Room for Improvement

* Design more code from scratch
* Find a way to run the algorithm with a more traditionally sized key (often 1024 bits)
